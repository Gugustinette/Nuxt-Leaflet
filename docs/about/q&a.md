# Q&A

## Will Leaflet.draw be supported in the future ?

[Leaflet.draw](https://leaflet.github.io/Leaflet.draw/docs/leaflet-draw-latest.html) was created to provide a simple way to draw shapes on a map made with Leaflet.

However, as the project is not maintained anymore (last update in 2018, see [Github repository](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw)), we choose not to include its support in the module.
