::: warning
Further documentation for these components was mostly copied from the [Vue2 Leaflet Documentation](https://vue2-leaflet.netlify.app/components/) and [Vue Leaflet Demo](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet/tree/master/src/playground/views).

This still needs better documentation and examples.

If you find any errors, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gugustinette/Nuxt-Leaflet).
Props and events can be verified by looking at the [vue-leaflet components](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet/tree/master/src/components).
