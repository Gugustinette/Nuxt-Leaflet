Further documentation for these components was highly inspired from [Vue2 Leaflet Documentation](https://vue2-leaflet.netlify.app/components/), [Vue Leaflet Demo](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet/tree/master/src/playground/views) and the original [Leaflet Documentation](https://leafletjs.com/).

If you find any errors, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gugustinette/Nuxt-Leaflet).
Props and events can be verified by looking at the [vue-leaflet components](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet/tree/master/src/components).
